                    I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a strong focus on <span className="font-semibold text-blue-600">JavaScript/TypeScript</span> and <span className="font-semibold text-green-600">Python</span>.
                    What drives me is the endless possibilities of creating digital solutions that solve real-world problems.

                    Based in <span className="font-semibold">Estonia</span>, I began my journey as a self-taught developer, driven by curiosity and a love for learning.
                    This foundation has instilled in me a deep appreciation for continuous growth and exploration of new technologies.

                    Recently, I've been expanding my horizons by diving into different programming languages and frameworks.
                    My goal is ambitious yet exciting: to create at least one meaningful project in as many languages as possible,
                    constantly pushing the boundaries of what I can build.
                </p>

                    Beyond web development, I'm fascinated by the intersection of technology and everyday life,
                    always looking for opportunities to create tools that make people's lives easier and more efficient.
